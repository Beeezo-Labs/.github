# Welcome to Beeezo on GitHub

Beeezo is a Web3 platform that transforms everyday screen time into earnings through verified, interactive quests centered on blockchain, AI, digital identity, and decentralized technologies. We connect users with real brands and projects via tasks like watching content, following accounts, posting, taking surveys, testing apps, staking, swapping, or holding tokens. Rewards come as Reward Coins (RC), redeemable for USDC at a rate of 1,000 RC = 1 USDC. Security and authenticity are key: all interactions are verified to eliminate bots, with KYC required for withdrawals (users must be 18+). Some quests may include geographic restrictions—check details before starting. We focus on education, helping users gain practical knowledge in Web3 while earning stablecoin rewards.
